# Provenance (plan D6, author's decision of 2026-10-06): copied byte for byte from the old
# project, `concept-embeddings-RAG/src/concept_embeddings_rag/nodes/local_extraction.py` at old
# commit 9abdc26 (last commit touching it; old HEAD 42b987f), SHA-256 of the original
# dd745a9ac6a1024166f82c4a4c8c1dbe983c1ac3899817e6156aad025c26d83d. The original stays
# untouched and is only read. Its imports still name the old package; increment 5 adapts
# them for the GLiNER pass over QASPER units, and every change below this header is a diff
# against that digest.

"""Reading entities out of every paragraph with a local extractor (Phase 7, S2).

Phase 5 read the pool with a frontier generative model and paid 25.98 USD for 19,366
paragraphs. This module does the same job with a model that runs on the machine, so
that Phase 7 can measure how much of the Entity Hop gain survives a cheap extractor.

What it is *not*: a second extraction framework. The record it produces is the Phase 5
`ExtractionRecord`, unchanged, so `build_node_index`, `EntityHopStage` and the whole
evaluation path downstream of it need no edit at all. The only genuinely new thing here
is the conversion from spans to a record, and the artifact that carries a local run's
identity, timing and throughput.

The conversion is decision D6 of the phase plan, and nothing about it is decided later:

1. The extractor sees **only** `unit.indexable_text` - title plus paragraph, what both
   retrievers index. A question, an answer, a gold annotation or a split cannot reach it
   by construction, exactly as in Phase 5.
2. Every span's **surface text** is taken verbatim, stripped of surrounding whitespace.
   No lemmatization, no casing change, no canonicalization: `normalization-v1` is this
   project's only normalizer and it runs later, inside `build_node_index`.
3. Forms are **deduplicated by exact surface**, first occurrence kept. A tagger emits one
   span per *mention*; Claude was asked for one item per *distinct name*, and this is
   what makes the two comparable.
4. **Bounds, then failure, never repair.** More than `MAX_NODES_PER_TYPE` forms, or one
   longer than `MAX_NODE_CHARS`, makes the record `failed` with reason `bounds` - the
   same code the eight Phase 5 failures carry. Nothing is truncated to fit.
5. A paragraph longer than the model's reading window is split at **its own sentence
   boundaries** into the fewest consecutive windows that each fit, and the forms of its
   windows are unioned. The *indexing* unit is untouched: only the extractor's reading
   window is split, and on this corpus the rule reaches 131 of 19,366 units.

`concepts` is always empty: Phase 5's gate returned NAMES ONLY, and Phase 7 changes the
extractor rather than the representation. Token counts are zero because no local run is
billed, and `prompt_digest` carries the candidate's **configuration digest** - that field
has always meant "which configuration produced this record", and a local extractor has no
prompt.

Nothing here reads a question, a split or a gold annotation, and no node form is ever
printed: entity forms are corpus text and have no place in a log.
